# Security Policy

Sample Tagger is currently an early-stage prototype.  
Security practices scale with each phase of development.

## Phase 1 â€” MVP (No User Accounts)
âœ… Spotify credentials stored in Vercel environment variables  
âœ… HTTPS enforced by Vercel  
âœ… Input validation on playlist URLs  
âœ… Dependencies monitored via Dependabot  
ðŸ”² Rate limiting on token endpoint *(planned)*

## Phase 2 â€” User Accounts Launch
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security in database  
- [ ] Harden authentication and session handling  
- [ ] Add security headers (via helmet.js or middleware)  
- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA on registration/login forms  

---

## Phase 3 â€” Scale / Growth
- [ ] Introduce advanced monitoring and alerting (e.g. Sentry)  
- [ ] Draft and test an incident response runbook  
- [ ] Commission an external security audit
